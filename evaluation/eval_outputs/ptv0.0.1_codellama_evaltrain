Generation: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business.business_id) AS open_businesses, COUNT(DISTINCT business.business_id) AS closed_businesses

### Explanation:
The query first selects all the businesses in the city of San Francisco where is_open = 1. Then, it counts the number of distinct businesses in the result set. The result set is then grouped by is_open, which means that the query will return two rows: one for open businesses and one for closed businesses. The COUNT(DISTINCT business.business_id) function counts the number of distinct businesses in each group.

- Accurately answers the user’s question.
- Adheres to standard Postgres SQL syntax.
- References the correct table and column names based on the schema.
