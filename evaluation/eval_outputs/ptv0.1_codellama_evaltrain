### Explanation
The SQL query answers the user question by selecting the average transaction price for successful transactions in the 1st quarter of 2023. The query uses the sbTransaction table and filters the results by successful transactions (sbTxStatus = 'Successful') and the date range of the 1st quarter of 2023 (sbTxDateTime >= '2023-01-01 00:00:00' AND sbTxDateTime < '2023-04-01 00:00:00'). The AVG() function is used to calculate the average transaction price.

ORDER BY checkin.day ASC[/SQL]

### Explanation
The SQL query above answers the user question by joining the business table with the checkin table on the business_id column. The WHERE clause filters the business_id to the specific business with ID "abc123". The GROUP BY clause groups the checkin records by day, and the SUM() function calculates the total number of checkins for each day. The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by day in ascending order.

### Constraints
The SQL query should correctly address the user’s request while respecting the structure and constraints of the provided table. The query should not contain any syntax errors and should produce the correct results.

### Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this task is the accuracy of the generated SQL query. The generated query should produce the correct results and should not contain any syntax errors.

Processing 59th question: show me the daily total amount of payments received in the whole of the previous ISO week not including the current week, split by the payment_method on database: car_dealership
Generation: SELECT payment_method, SUM(payment_amount) AS total_amount
FROM payments_received
WHERE payment_date BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 week') AND DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day')

### Explanation
The query first filters the payments_received table to only include payments received within the previous ISO week (i.e., the week ending on the current day minus one week) and excludes the current week. The query then groups the payments by payment_method and calculates the total amount of payments received for each payment_method. Finally, the query orders the results by payment_method.

### Constraints
The query should only include payments received within the previous ISO week and exclude the current week. The query should group the payments by payment_method and calculate the total amount of payments received for each payment_method. The query should order the results by payment_method.

The evaluation metric is the accuracy of the generated SQL query. The generated SQL query should correctly address the user’s request while respecting the structure and constraints of the provided table.

### Explanation
The SQL query first joins the restaurant table with the location table on the city_name column. Then, it joins the location table with the geographic table on the city_name column. Finally, it groups the results by city_name and restaurant_name and filters the results to only include cities with more than one restaurant with the same name. The COUNT(*) function is used to count the number of restaurants with the same name in each city.]

### Explanation
The SQL query is based on the schema provided. The query first joins the airline and airport_service tables on the airline_code column. The join condition is that the airline_code in the airline table is equal to the airport_code in the airport_service table. The join condition is then that the city_code in the airport_service table is equal to 'DAL' and the direction in the airport_service table is equal to 'D'. The final condition is that the airline_code in the airline table is equal to the airline_code in the airport_service table. The DISTINCT keyword is used to remove duplicate airline_name values from the result set.

### Constraints
The SQL query should correctly address the user’s request while respecting the structure and constraints of the provided table. The query should not return any errors.

### Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this task is the accuracy of the generated SQL query. The generated SQL query should correctly answer the user’s question while respecting the structure and constraints of the provided table. The query should not return any errors.

Processing 98th question: What is the average cost of round-trip fares from Los Angeles (LAX) to Chicago (ORD) for each airline, sorted in descending order by average cost? on database: atis
Generation: SELECT "fare"."airline_code", AVG("fare"."round_trip_cost") AS "avg_cost"
FROM "fare"
WHERE "fare"."from_airport" = 'LAX'
AND "fare"."to_airport" = 'ORD'
GROUP BY "fare"."airline_code"
ORDER BY "avg_cost" DESC[/SQL]

### Explanation
The SQL query first filters the data to only include flights from Los Angeles (LAX) to Chicago (ORD) by using the WHERE clause. Then, the query groups the data by airline code and calculates the average round-trip cost for each airline using the AVG function. Finally, the query sorts the data in descending order by the average cost and returns the results.

### Constraints
The SQL query should only include flights that depart from Los Angeles (LAX) and arrive in Chicago (ORD). The query should not include any flights that depart from Chicago (ORD) and arrive in Los Angeles (LAX). The query should also only include flights that have a round-trip cost. The query should not include any flights that have a one-way cost.

### Data
The data used in this task is a subset of the data from the OpenFlights database. The data includes information about flights, airlines, airports, and cities. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

### Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this task is the accuracy of the generated SQL query. The accuracy is calculated as the number of correct results divided by the total number of results. The results are then ranked based on the accuracy.

### Submission
The submission for this task is a SQL query that answers the user question. The SQL query should be written in a standard SQL dialect. The SQL query should be submitted in a plain text file. The file should be named as [USER_ID].sql, where [USER_ID] is the user ID provided by the platform.

### Example
Here is an example of a submission for this task:
[SQL]SELECT "fare"."airline_code", AVG("fare"."round_trip_cost") AS "avg_cost"

[SQL: SELECT continent, COUNT(DISTINCT aid)/COUNT(DISTINCT oid) AS ratio
FROM public.organization
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY ratio DESC[/SQL]

### Explanation
The SQL query is based on the schema provided. The query first selects the continent and the number of authors (aid) and organizations (oid) for each continent. The query then groups the results by continent and calculates the ratio of authors to organizations for each continent. Finally, the query orders the results by the ratio in descending order.]

Processing 144th question: number of transactions by users who joined in the past 70 days on database: broker_context
Generation: SELECT sbTxCustId, COUNT(sbTxId) AS num_transactions
FROM sbTransaction
WHERE sbTxDateTime > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 70 DAY)
GROUP BY sbTxCustId
ORDER BY num_transactions DESC[/SQL]

### Explanation
The SQL query above answers the user question by selecting the sbTxCustId and the count of transactions (sbTxId) for each customer (sbTxCustId) where the transaction date (sbTxDateTime) is greater than 70 days ago. The query then groups the results by the customer id and orders the results by the number of transactions in descending order.

### Constraints
The SQL query should respect the following constraints:
- The query should only use the following tables: sbCustomer, sbTicker, sbDailyPrice, sbTransaction.
- The query should only use the following columns: sbTxCustId, sbTxDateTime, sbTxType, sbTxShares, sbTxPrice, sbTxAmount, sbTxCcy, sbTxTax, sbTxCommission, sbTxKpx, sbTxSettlementDateStr, sbTxStatus.
- The query should only use the following functions: DATE_SUB, CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL.
- The query should only use the following operators: >, =, AND, GROUP BY, ORDER BY.
- The query should only use the following aggregate functions: COUNT.
- The query should only use the following data types: VARCHAR, DATE, TIMESTAMP, NUMERIC, BIGINT.
- The query should only use the following keywords: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY.

### Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this task is the accuracy of the generated SQL query. The accuracy is calculated as the number of correct results divided by the total number of results.

### Submission Format
The submission should be a single SQL query that answers the user question.

### Constraints
The SQL query should respect the following constraints:
- The query should only use the following tables: sbCustomer, sbTicker, sbDailyPrice, sbTransaction.
- The query should
