Processing 0th question: What is the total number of credits earned by students in each program? on database: advising

JOIN student ON student_record.student_id = student.student_id
GROUP BY program.name
[/SQL]

### Explanation
The query joins the tables program, program_course, course, student_record, and student to get the total number of credits earned by students in each program. The query uses the following joins:

* program and program_course: program_course.program_id = program.program_id to get the program_id for each program.
* program_course and course: program_course.course_id = course.course_id to get the course_id for each course.
* course and student_record: course.course_id = student_record.course_id to get the course_id for each student_record.
* student_record and student: student_record.student_id = student.student_id to get the student_id for each student_record.

The query then uses the GROUP BY clause to group the results by program.name and the SUM function to get the total number of credits earned by students in each program.
