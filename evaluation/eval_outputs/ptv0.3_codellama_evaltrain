### Explanation
The query joins the course table with the program_course table and the program table. The program_course table contains the course_id and program_id columns. The program table contains the program_id and name columns. The query filters the results to only include courses that have a program_id that matches the program_id of the Computer Science program. The DISTINCT keyword is used to remove duplicate course names from the results.

The SQL query above answers the question by selecting the course ID and the ratio of helpfulness scores to clarity scores for each course ID. The query uses the course table to access the helpfulness and clarity scores for each course ID. The query then divides the helpfulness score by the clarity score to calculate the ratio. The result is a table with two columns: course ID and the ratio of helpfulness scores to clarity scores.

### Explanation
The query uses a LEFT JOIN to combine the program and student tables. The COUNT(DISTINCT student.student_id) function counts the number of unique student_id values for each program. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each student_id is counted only once, even if they have declared multiple majors. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by program name, and the SELECT clause selects the program name and the number of students.
