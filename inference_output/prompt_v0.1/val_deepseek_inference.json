If you're using a different SQL variant, the equivalent operator might be different. For example, in MySQL, you would use the \"IN\" operator to achieve the same result.\n\nIf the \"location\" field is not unique, you would need to group by \"location\" and then use a HAVING clause to filter for the desired conditions.
